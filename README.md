Neon Night - Theme for IDLE
=====================

A dark and colorful alternative theme for Python's IDLE.

Simply navigate to your .idlerc folder, and drop these in. If you already have custom themes that you'd like to keep, paste this theme below your old one. Finally, replace your config-main.cfg with mine.
